A fun way to learn languages. Create collections with cards and utilize the help of AI to generate explanations and translations.

This project was created for the [Supabase Launch Week 7](https://supabase.com/launch-week) hackathon.

In this project, I used Supabase as a **database** to store collections and cards with row level security. I also used it for user authentication. Users can sign up with their email address and password. Policies protect the database tables from unauthorized access.
